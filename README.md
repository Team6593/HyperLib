# HyperLib
As of January 6 (Kickoff), this library is undergoing rapid, and big updates, expect things to break, and be written.

Java FRC library built by HyperDrive Robotics Team 6593

A small collection of utility classes to help you write less boilerplate code.

Includes things such as:
- A DriveFilter that allows for smooth driving with acceleration
- An optimized AprilTag Detection class that can detect AprilTags with one function call(*) + helper function
- LimeLight, and TalonFX helper classes
